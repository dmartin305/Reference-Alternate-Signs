# Alternate signs

*Created by David Martin on 1/24/22* 

##### Reference videos for Kaggle ASL Data QA
##### If you encounter a signer who uses a different sign than the DPAN reference videos and are unsure if you should mark it as incorrect, take a look at these links. 

######Disclaimer: I have not gone through this list to confirm that the sign exists in their dictionary. If thats the case you can use the search function on their website.
